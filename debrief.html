<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<p>
    Documentation was good, the feature was easy to enable
</p>
<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<p>
    No. We wondered about optional checkboxes for newletter signup or GDPR opt-in but this would have to be stored somehow - custom fields?  Maybe another feature.
