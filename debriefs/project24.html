<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<li>
    We were able to easily configure the rules engine to support the use case of 3DS with a BIN list, then by country.
</li>
<p>

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        We tried using gateway restrictions but were not able to accomplish the configuration since there are only "AND" conditions.
    </li>
    <li>
        When configuring the rules there are so many filters that do not seem to apply.
    </li>
    <li>
        Digital wallet persisted after deactivation, so the same card could never be used to test 3DS. This is only really an issue on sandbox.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the testing we had to know to use the test cards from Rebilly.
    </li>
</ul>
