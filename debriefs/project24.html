<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        It took a while to find the IPN URL in the gateway account screen.
    </li>
    <li>
        We didn't get a dispute for an amount of 1040, even though the documentation says we should.
    </li>
    <li>
        The dispute was not properly mapped. It should be type=fraud.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the email notification form, some placeholders are shown multiple times.
    </li>
    <li>
        We got the email, but gmail reports that DKIM and DMARC failed. Since the email is from colin.bird@rebilly.com but the headers are for mg.rebilly.email.
    </li>
    <li>
        It seems like we should use a value like no-reply@mgs.rebilly.com and use the reply-to: address for the from address saved by the user in Recomm. This way it will not be marked as spam.
    </li>
</ul>
