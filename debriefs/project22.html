<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<li>
    Volume limits were easy to configure, we found the configuration under the gateway account. Although it wasn't in the typical settings screen.

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        We were not able to configure a volume limit in CAD since our reporting currency is USD.
    </li>
    <li>
        The exercise asks to set D then C then E gateway priority but this is not possible with the weighted gateway selection rule. We effectively achieved this by setting the weights to D:999999999999999 and C:1 (and E:0).

        The limits are calculated by cron job running every 5 minutes. This is not ideal for a live system. We would prefer to see the limits calculated in real-time. It's possible to go over the volume limits within 5 minutes.
