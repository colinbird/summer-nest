<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<li>
    Mike was able to use the AI docs search to find out how to configure most steps.

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Mike, with the help of the AI search, was able to find where to configure the rule to tag the VIP customers.
        <br/>`On Invoice paid -> InvoiceCustomerLifetime revenueAmountgreater or equal to 10000 -> Add tag VIP`
        <br/>
        But invoices are not created for all transactions, so the event should be changed to `Transaction processed`.
        <br/>This isn't a bug but it's easy to see merchants doing this.
    </li>
    <li>
        Capitalization is wrong in the segment names. Should be "VIP"

    </li>
    <li>
        The AI recommended using deposit strategies to tag the VIP customers.
        <br>We are unable to edit filters on deposit strategies. Seems like a bug.

    </li>
    <li>
        Gateway account restrictions would be a perfect place to ensure that only VIP customers could use Skrill, but tags are not available in the filters, unfortunately.

    </li>
    <li>
        Another way to do this is with the gateway account selected event, tags are available there.

    </li>
    <li>
        <br>It seems the best way (besides the gateway account restriction which doesn't work) would be the `ready to pay was requested` rule.
        <img src="/rtp-requested.png" alt="Ready to pay requested">
        <br>We have so many ways to accomplish this, having docs on the best practices would be helpful.
    </li>
    <li>
        Actually we noticed that the AI search is a great way to test if our docs cover the topics. When we have good docs, the AI is able to find the answers.
    </li>
