<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<li>
    Automated blocklist on dispute created worked. That was the only thing that worked.
</li>
<p>

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The UI was quite frustrating. We didn't understand the predefined automations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Predefined automations didn't have any descriptions. We had to guess what they did. And the names, ie: "Transaction Processed" couldn't be much worse.
    </li>
    <li>
        Predefined automations do not show up in the list of automations. But if you enable and disable them, they do.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you enable an automation, but then don't disable it, you can't save the form.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's not clear that a TTL expiry of 0 is unlimited.
    </li>
    <li>
        Normal blocklist validation requires 30 seconds or higher TTL, this is not enforced in the blocklist automations.
    </li>
    <li>
        The automations need some space between them, they are confusing to look at.
    </li>
    <li>
        None of the automations actually worked. It seems like we are not calculating risk score for PostStorefrontPayout.
    </li>
</ul>
