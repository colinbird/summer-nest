<h3>What made us smile</h3>
    <li>
        Configuring the deposit strategies was fairly straightforward.
    </li>
<p>

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        In general the flow is not clear in the docs. The "deposit link" is mentioned but is not included in the example response or in the response definition.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's not clear if we need to initiate the transaction with the deposit request ID or to follow this link.
    </li>
    <li>
        Clicking on deposit strategy copies ID instead of opening edit mode. We kept clicking it to try to edit the strategy.
    </li>
    <li>
        When debugging 422 error, the API logs do not show up quickly. Need to keep reloading to see it.
    </li>
    <li>
        The increment configuration in the deposit strategy is not clear. Without testing it's not clear which amounts will show up.
    </li>
    <li>
        Should instruments support multiple currencies? We had to add a currency selector manually.
    </li>
    <li>
        Anytime the customer changes the currency selection, we create a "dangling" deposit request. A bad actor could flood the system with deposit requests.
    </li>
</ul>
