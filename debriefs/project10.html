<h3>What made us smile</h3>

<p>
    Documentation was good, framepay was easy to set up and obtain payment token
</p>
<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        It was not clear at the beginning what to do with the payment token. We had to guess that we needed to create a
        transaction in the backend.
        Maybe it should be add to the docs to have the full process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Not sure if all the information in the provided example was relevant, it was a bit overwhelming. Because in the selected solution, add-ons are just
        adding more quantity to the money in the payment token creation step.
    </li>
</ul>
