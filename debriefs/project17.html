<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<li>
    Once Mike found the rules, he was able to set it up quickly. He was able to configure the rule for "Ready to payout requested"
</li>

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When selecting the payout methods, it may be better to have a list where you can pick which ones you want, instead of having to add each one individually</li>

    <li>It seems there are a lot of conditions that don't apply.  As far as we understand, for Ready To Payout there is no invoice, transaction etc but all of those condition fields are shown</li>

    <li>It wasn't clear how to configure the conditions for country, primary address country didn't seem to work. Neither did riskmetadata country</li>

    <li>We can see in the Ready to Payout API request, that we are sending a "billing address" but how do we configure it in the rules?</li>

    <li>How are we supposed to get the country? From the IP address?  IP address is not sent in the API request.</li>
    
</ul>
