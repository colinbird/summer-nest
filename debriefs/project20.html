<h3>What made us smile</h3>
<li>
    The preview of the amounts under the deposit strategy was a nice feature.
</li>
<li>
    But the way that you have to enter a base amount and then increment amount to get what you want is not intuitive.
</li>
<li>
    The new display of the payment methods is much nicer.
</li>
<p>

<h3>What was confusing, did you encounter any issues?</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        The documentation wasn't clear to us right away. There is the mixing of the terms "deposit" and "cashier".
    </li>
    <li>
        The term "cashier" was new to us and wasn't explained. Perhaps an introduction to what the Rebilly Cashier is would help.
    <li>
        The flow chart made sense once we had implemented the project, but at first it didn't make much sense to us.
    </li>
    </li>
    <li>
        The lightlighting of the sample code is annoying, and there is no copy button.
    </li>
    <li>
  We were not able to see which gateways had digital wallets configured.
